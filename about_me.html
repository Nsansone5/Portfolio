                    <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>

                    <p>My name is Nick and I am a Data Engineer at First Derivative, a global leader in capital market technical consulting services.  I am a recent graduate from Fordham University's Gabelli Graduate 
                        School of Business with a Master of Science in Business Analytics, having achieved a 4.0 overall GPA throughout the program.  I have also recieved a Bachelor of Arts in 
                        Mathematics from Boston College in the Spring of 2020.
                    </p>

                    <p>At First Derivative, I have established a comprehensive understanding and ability to work with the kdb+ database through
                        coding and programming within q.  Alongside this development, I have also reinforced my knowledge and expertise in Python, having passed the PCAP 
                        exam, becoming a Certified Associate in Python Programming.  Separate from expanding upon my analytical and technical foundation, software testing
                        has been an integral part of my role as a Data Engineer- mainly qa, regression, smoke, and user acceptance testing.
                    </p>

                    <p>Aside from my passion for working with and manipulating data, I am a huge New York and Los Angeles sports fan and thoroughly enjoy being
                        within a setting in which I am surrounded by people.  On top of my technical compentencies, I am engaged in promoting my analytical
                        capabilites through the independent learning of an array of software applications including PowerBI, Looker, Qlik, and C++.  To further
                        reinforce what I have learned in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I built this website organically to showcase both my skills and my portfolio.
